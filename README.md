# Real-Time-Object-Detection-with-YOLOv5-and-OpenCV-Using-a-Camera-Feed


In this project, I tried to detect objects in real time.

In order to achieve this goal, I used:
  - OpenCV to capture my webcam,
  - and [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) to detect object.

# Example of object detection
